Started to put the electronics into a box for actual use. For the fun and learning of it I am using OnShape to work out the box dimensions and layout. I loved that I was able to create the digital logic components of the circuit in KiCad, using the PCB designer tool to layout those components on a perf-board, then export that perf-board as a 3D model, which I then imported into OnShape as a part for use in the physical box model. Nice.

For using KiCad to layout a perf-board see good article @ [https://forum.arduino.cc/t/perfboard-circuit-design-with-kicad/1283999](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/perfboard-circuit-design-with-kicad/1283999)

Completed fully working prototype. Have it running to control temperature in a cardboard box on my work table upstairs. So far, so good.

Using ChatGPT I created the first proof of concept of reading the temp sensor, comparing to a set-point that is based on a pot connected to an analog input pin, and turning the 'heater' device (i.e., output pin) on or off. See the sketch "TEST_ControlSetPoint."

Began creating what I hope to be the production sketch architecture.

I have the sketch 'POC_ButtonPress' working; and it does turn the SSR and attached light on/off as expected.

## Starting with a Fresh ATTiny Chip

I also started with a new install of the Arduino IDE as I had upgraded my PC to latest Fedora recently. So I downloaded the Arduino IDE appimage and then followed the instructions in the note "Arduino Setup for ATTiny Chips" that is in my general Notes repository and got the Blink sketch working.
